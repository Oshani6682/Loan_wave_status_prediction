                How We Work
            </h1>
            <Card body>Loanwave Solutions is not your typical loan provider. We use cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms 
                to analyze a wide range of factors—beyond just your credit score—ensuring that you receive loan options that are 
                uniquely suited to your financial situation. Our intelligent platform evaluates variables like your employment 
                history, spending patterns, and financial behavior to offer tailored loan recommendations. This approach not only 
                increases your chances of approval but also ensures that the loan you receive aligns with your ability to repay it.</Card>
